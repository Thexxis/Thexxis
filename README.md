- 👋 Hi, I’m @Thexxis
- 👀 I’m interested in ... video game composition, game design, level design, games programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Rust, C++, Python,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...open source game projects!
- 📫 How to reach me ... here on github or on discord! (Thexxis#3338)

I have my Bachelor's Degree in Music Composition, but have had a passion for computer programming throughout high school
and college. I didn't get many opportunities to learn about programming during my time in college, so a large majority of
my programming knowledge is self-taught from online courses (like Udemy) and from books.

I'm most comfortable working in C++ and Rust, but I definitely have more experience learning C++ (I'd still consider myself
a beginner though!), but I see Rust becoming more and more pervasive in the general programming world, and I actually find
it a lot of fun to work in! A lot of my work in Python is actually using GDScript in the Godot Game Engine, which isn't
technically Python, but is like a carbon copy of Python in terms of syntax and operation.

All in all, if you're looking to me for my expertise, you'll definitely be happier when reaching out to me regarding 
composing music for your project. That's where my university education lies, and I am much more comfortable lending my music
expertise vs. my programming experience. BUT if you're looking for a "jack of all trades" that you're willing to teach a little,
then I'm your guy!
